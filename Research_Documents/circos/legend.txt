1) The outer circle represents reference sequence with GC (%) heatmap [from 0% (white) to 55% (black)].

2) Assembly tracks:
	assembly1 - P_cali_8
Assembly tracks are combined with mismatches visualization: higher columns indicate larger mismatch rate.

3) User-provided genes. A darker color indicates higher density of genes.
